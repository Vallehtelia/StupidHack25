## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### OpenAI API Errors
- **"API key not found"**: Make sure your `.env` file contains `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
- **"Rate limit exceeded"**: Wait a moment and try again, or check your OpenAI usage

#### Server Connection Issues
- **Port 3001 already in use**: Kill existing processes with `pkill -f "node server.js"`
- **Port 5173 already in use**: Kill existing processes with `pkill -f "vite"`

#### Python Script Issues
- **"Module not found"**: Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- **"Permission denied"**: Make sure `shrek.py` is executable: `chmod +x shrek.py`

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Check if both servers are running
curl http://localhost:5173  # Frontend
curl http://localhost:3001  # Backend

# Test Shrek API directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/shrek \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello Shrek!"}'
```
